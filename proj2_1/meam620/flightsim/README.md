# Flightsim

Flightsim is a simple dynamics simulator for teaching aerial robotics planning and control.

It was developed to cater to the University of Pennsylvania aerial robotics class, and so it has unique aspirations.
* Small. Unlike a black box simulatator, the engine is intended to be transparent from top to bottom to a student of robotics.
* Easy to install. Dependencies are minimized to ensure easy native installation on Linux, Windows, and Mac.
* Pedagogical. Structure and notation mirror course content, and documentation should be precise.

# License

The package flightsim itself is released under the MIT License. Contributions of improvements, bug fixes, and documentation are welcome. Course instructors would enjoy hearing if you use flightsim as a template for other projects.

Please note that flightsim (and its open source license) does not include course materials such as assignments, solutions, and server integrations.
